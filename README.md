- This code allows you to search for images using a form, view the results and;oad more images by clicking a button.  It uses the Unsplash API to fetch the images and dosplays them in a grid with an overlay containing the image's atl description.  The overlay appears when the uses hover over an image, the load more button allows users to fetch more images without leaving the page or submitting the form again.  Infinite Scrolling.

- After attempting with some APIs, that did not work, this was the one that the keys were working, and honestly most of them were very hard methods.  
- I watched many tutorials in Youtube, research many pages such as:
- Stack Overflow
- W3 Schools 
- Youtube
and others
